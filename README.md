A dual axis solar tracker that finds which direction is producing the most light output and turning the device to face said direction. The device uses 4 photo-resistors which are separated by a 3-D printed divider. A solar panel is mounted on the front of the device which will use the direct sunlight to produce energy. Two servos are used: one servo spins the device horizontally while the other flips the top panel vertically.
